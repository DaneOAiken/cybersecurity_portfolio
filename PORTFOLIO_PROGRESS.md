## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Do This First)
1. **Update GitHub repo info** - Replace placeholder links in README:
   - Your GitHub username
   - LinkedIn profile
   - Email address
   - Any badge URLs

2. **Copy screenshots** - Make sure all images from PDFs are in the right folders:
   - Extract images from hw2, hw7 PDFs
   - Place in appropriate `assets/images/` folders

3. **Test navigation** - Make sure all links work between READMEs

### Phase 2: Continue Documentation (Next Session)
1. Extract hw1 (Python) content and create writeup
2. Extract hw4 (Advanced Web) content and create writeup
3. Extract hw6 (Forensics II) content and create writeup
4. Extract hw8 (Advanced RE) content and create writeup
5. Extract FCTF content and create writeup

### Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement
1. Add actual screenshots from your PDFs to the writeups
2. Create a GitHub profile README
3. Add code snippets/scripts where applicable
4. Consider creating visual diagrams for complex attacks
