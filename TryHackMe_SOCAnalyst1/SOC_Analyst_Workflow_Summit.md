# TryHackMe: Summit Room

## ðŸ”Ž Overview
The **Summit** room on TryHackMe follows the **Pyramid of Pain** model, where each stage of the challenge requires detecting and blocking adversary activity using progressively stronger indicators.  
This exercise simulated a **purple team scenario**: an adversary executing malware samples on a workstation while I configured security controls to detect and prevent them.  
I completed all stages, from hash-based detection to building Sigma rules for advanced indicators.

### ðŸ§© Stage 1: Hash-Based Detection
**Process**
1. Submitted `sample1.exe` to the malware sandbox.  
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit11.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>
2. Retrieved the **SHA256 hash** of the malicious file.  
3. Added the hash to the blocklist using the **Manage Hashes** panel.  
<p align="center">

</p>
4. Earned the flag, which showed that the protections were successful.  

**Key Skills:** Malware sandboxing, hash-based detection

### ðŸ§© Stage 2: IP Blocking
**Process**
1. Submitted `sample2.exe` for analysis.  
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit21.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 
2. Observed network traffic pointing to malicious IP `154.35.10.113`.
3. Created a firewall **egress rule** to block outbound connections to that IP.

</p>

4. Earned the flag, which showed that the protections were successful.    

**Key Skills:** Firewall management, egress filtering, network-based detection

### ðŸ§© Stage 3: DNS Filtering
**Process**
1. Analyzed `sample3.exe` behavior in the sandbox.

  <img src="assets/images/summit31.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 
2. Identified a suspicious domain (`emudyn.bresonicz.info`).  
3. Configured a **DNS Filter rule** to block the malicious domain.  
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit32.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 
4. Verified detection and received the corresponding flag.  

**Key Skills:** DNS analysis, domain blocking, detection engineering

### ðŸ§© Stage 4: Registry Monitoring with Sigma
**Process**
1. Executed `sample4.exe` and reviewed behavior analysis.  
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit41.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 
2. Observed **Windows Defender real-time protection disabled** via registry modification.  
3. Built a **Sigma rule** targeting changes to:  
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit42.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 <p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit43.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 
4. Earned the flag, which showed that the protections were successful.    

**Key Skills:** Sigma rules, Sysmon event logs, MITRE ATT&CK mapping  


---

### ðŸ§© Stage 5: Outgoing Connections Log
**Process**
1. Reviewed the provided `outgoing_connections.log` file.  
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit51.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 <p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit52.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 
2. Identified repeated connections to IP `51.102.10.19` every 30 minutes over port 443 with fixed packet sizes.  
3. Created a **custom Sigma rule** to detect this pattern in Sysmon event logs.  
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit21.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  

4. Successfully blocked the activity and confirmed the flag.  

**Key Skills:** Log analysis, Sigma rule building, traffic pattern detection  


---

### ðŸ§© Stage 6: Command and File Exfiltration
**Process**
1. Analyzed `commands.log` output from the adversary malware.  
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit61.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 
2. Detected suspicious file creation: `%temp%\exfiltr8.log`.  
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit62.png.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 
3. Built a **Sigma rule** for file creation events pointing to `%temp%` directory with filename `exfiltr8.log`.  
4. Mapped the detection to **MITRE ATT&CK Exfiltration (TA0010)**.  
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/summit63.png" alt="malware sandbox results" width="500"/>
</p>  
 
5. Earned the flag, which showed that the protections were successful.  

**Key Skills:** File activity monitoring, exfiltration detection, ATT&CK alignment
