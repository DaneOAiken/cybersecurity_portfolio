# TryHackMe â€” SOC Analyst I Path ðŸ“ŠðŸ”’

This folder contains my write-ups and hands-on work for rooms in the **TryHackMe SOC Analyst I learning path**.  
These exercises focus on **detection, analysis, and response** â€” the core skills of a SOC or Junior Cybersecurity Analyst.  

Iâ€™m actively working through more rooms in this path, so this portfolio will continue to expand.

## ðŸ“‚ Completed Projects

### 1. [Friday Overtime](OSINT_Friday_Overtime.md)
- **Focus:** Threat intelligence & malware analysis  
- **Skills Demonstrated:**  
  - Extracting and hashing suspicious files (`sha1sum`, `unzip`, Linux navigation)  
  - Malware framework attribution (MgBot / Evasive Panda APT)  
  - IOC enrichment with **CyberChef** (defanging URLs/IPs)  
  - OSINT investigation with **VirusTotal** and open-source reporting  
  - Mapping behaviors to **MITRE ATT&CK**  
- **Recruiter Insight:** Shows ability to work as a CTI/SOC analyst, moving from raw malware artifacts to actionable intelligence.

### 2. [SOC_Analyst_Workflow_Summit.md](SOC_Analyst_Workflow_Summit.md)
- **Focus:** Detection engineering & SOC operations  
- **Skills Demonstrated:**  
  - Hash-based detection in malware sandboxes  
  - IP/domain blocking with firewall and DNS filter rules  
  - Writing **custom Sigma rules** for registry, file, and network activity  
  - Leveraging **Sysmon logs** for detection tuning  
  - Aligning detections with the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework  
- **Recruiter Insight:** Demonstrates the ability to build layered defenses (Pyramid of Pain) and write behavioral detections â€” critical SOC analyst skills.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next
I plan to continue this path by completing additional rooms that expand my capabilities in:  
- SIEM tools & log analysis  
- Incident response workflows  
- Malware investigation  
- Advanced detection engineering  

Each completed room will include a dedicated README with process steps, screenshots, and takeaways.
